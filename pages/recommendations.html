                            It's made by the same director, who pays attention to great details in movies. Plus, that other movie's characters make cameos here.

                        <p>
                            Both movies have supernatural themes, and romantic relationships developing between their poster couples.

                            Both explore the difficulties that arise from body-swapping, such as the impact on daily lives and coping with the invasiveness of it.

                        <h1>Koe no Katachi</h1>
                        <p>
                            Both Kimi no Na wa and Koe no Katachi are romantic films featuring young people who are on the cusp of adulthood. They are both emotionally moving with beautiful artwork and animation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Koe no Katachi doesn't have the same supernatural element that comes with Kimi no Na wa, but it has a similar impact. However, while Koe no Katachi is appropriate for adolescent viewers, it does deal with some severe bullying and darker themes that are absent in Kimi no Na wa, so if that is something that is difficult for you, you may want to avoid this film.

                            Same director, similar theme of heartbreak, similar use of train metaphor of life going in different paths but always going onward. Both are beautiful artistically and I hold them both as my two favorite Makoto Shinkai films.

                        <h1>Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo</h1>
                        <p>
                            Instead of being reminded of Shinkai's other FAR more melancholic/sappy offerings, watching Your Name reminded me very much of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time in tone and direction. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They begin as something akin to 'supernatural sit-coms' where a supernatural element is inserted into the daily lives of high school kids and fun silliness ensues. They do later switch their emphasis to drama but there's never an overwhelming sense of despair.

                            Both stories are wonderful and very exciting. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. The animations are similar and the story is moving, too.
